An R package to investigate the impacts of ecosystem variability on recruitment using full MCMC results

This packages functionalises, generalises, and extends our methods developed by
Haigh et al. (2019, Appendix F), to quantitatively detect environmental
influences on annual recruitment of a stock , using a suite of indicators
avaiable in our [pacea](https://github.com/pbs-assess/pacea) R package.

Crucially, the methods use the full uncertainties of recruitment (and mortality
if desired) as estimated by an assessment model, not just average estimates for
each year. Technically, this is done by using all Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) samples, rather than just summary statistics. This aspect of the method was particularly well received at a national DFO workshop (Edwards et al. 2017).

The package is currently under construction and not intended to be operational yet.

## Installation

To install the latest version just:

```
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

remotes::install_github("pbs-assess/recruitea")
```

If you get an error like
```
Error in utils::download.file(....)
```
then the connection may be timing out (happens to us on the DFO network). Try

```
options(timeout = 1200)
```
and then try and install again. If you get a different error then post an Issue
or contact <a href="mailto:andrew.edwards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca">Andy</a> for help.
