# hake-2024/hake_mcmc.rds contains a large tibble, with each row being an MCMC
# sample, and columns representing various things we might want to look
# at. Extracting some of the useful ones here to save as data objects. Will then
# come back to this to save more.

# Change assess_yr each year, the rest is automated.

# hake_recruitment will become the latest assessment results, and
#  hake_recruitment_2023 retains the 2023 assessment results, this is then ongoing for
#  each year. So hake_recruitment_<assess_yr> = hake_recruitment.
#  See ?hake for details.
